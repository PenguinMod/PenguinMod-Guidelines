# Project Uploading & Updating guidelines
*These guidelines do not affect projects uploaded before May 25th 2023, unless those projects get updated.*

## Important Note
These guidelines only apply to PenguinMod's project sharing.

If you are packaging your project for release on other websites,
you should still follow their rules.

### Be respectful to others.
Your project cannot contain any derogatory terms (slurs).
You will likely get banned for posting a project with these.

Be respectful of any real-world events that harmed others in any way.
(ex: don't make fun of people who were affected, or don't make a comedic version of the event)

You cannot make reference to discrimination or discriminate of certain things like:
- Age
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual Orientation
- Gender & Pronouns
- Disabilities

Your project should not put others in danger. General rules for this are:
- You cannot force others to download malicious material or link them to malicious material.
- You cannot threaten others in any way.
- You cannot use their general location without full consent. If you need to, you can just put a pop-up asking if you can use their location, with a simple Yes and No button.

You cannot make reference to:
- Terrorism
- Suicide
- Doxxing
- Death Threats

### Use other platforms sparingly.
If you are linking to a seperate Discord or site anywhere on your project (including iframes),
your actions on that site (or the site itself if it is not a major platform) must not endanger others
or display content to them that is only appropriate for certain ages.

Ideally, external links should follow all rules here wherever they can.

### Projects must be safe for people 13 and under.
If your project contains blood, it must have a warning somewhere at the start of the project
and in the project instructions.

Sexual content cannot be included at all in your project, including references to sexual material such as genitals or pornographic websites.

### Limits on Blood and Violence
You cannot display:
- Realistic or real-world depictions of extreme gore, graphic violence, or death
- Animal abuse and torture (realistic or not)
Blood also cannot be realistic and human bodies/skeletons should be used lightly (do not have more than 1 in a scene).

### Do not prevent access to "See Inside" your project.
To approve your projects, moderators must be able to see the contents of the project.

By removing the ability to See Inside the project, we can't verify the contents of your project and will have to remove it.

### "Chatroom" Projects or Projects with a messaging feature
Your project **MUST** have moderation.
If you cannot moderate your project properly, it will be removed.

Your messaging feature cannot allow users to:
- Use a user-uploaded profile picture
- Attach images, video or any media
- Link to any websites
- Break any of the rules in the "Be respectful to others" section
